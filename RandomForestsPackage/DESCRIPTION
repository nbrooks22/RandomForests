Description:    For regression and classification problems this package allows the user to create
                CARTS (Classification and regression trees) through different methods. Functions 
                for the creation of CARTs via the greedy method and optimizing them through cost-complexity
                pruning are available. Finally the bagging and the random forest algorithm are 
                implemented.
